# Live in Moments - Event Photography & Polaroid Designer

### Project Overview
A responsive web application designed for a photography service that specializes in custom Polaroid prints. This project serves as a digital storefront where users can view service offerings, explore different polaroid styles, and calculate order pricing in real-time.

### Key Features
* **Dynamic Pricing Calculator:** A JavaScript-powered order form that calculates total costs based on selected polaroid types (Classic, Customized, or Mini) and quantity.
* **Responsive Portfolio Gallery:** A curated display of work and polaroid styles using CSS flexbox/grid principles.
* **Interactive UI:** Smooth navigation with anchor links and interactive call-to-action buttons for mail and phone integration.
* **Order Workflow:** Integrated user input validation to ensure valid quantities are entered before processing.

### Technologies Used
* **HTML5:** Structured the semantic layout of the landing page.
* **CSS3:** Styled the visual experience using Google Fonts (Poppins) and custom layout techniques.
* **JavaScript (ES6):** Implemented the logic for event handling, input retrieval, and price calculation.

### What I Learned
* **DOM Manipulation:** Practiced capturing user input from dropdowns and number fields to update the UI via alerts.
* **Conditional Logic:** Implemented price-tiering logic using JavaScript functions.
* **Frontend Design:** Focused on creating a clean, professional "vibe" suitable for a creative service business.
